# BASE-PYTHON-DATAMANIPULATION-OBJECTIVES
Base Python Manipulation project is focused on mastering fundamental data manipulation techniques using base python. By diving deep into these foundational aspects of python, you will build a solid understanding that forms the basis for more advanced programming concepts and applications.

# Conditional Statement : if statement, if-else statement, if-elif-else statement, Nested-if
Conditional statement in python are used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition evaluates to true or false.

# if statement:
Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
# if-else statement: 
It checks a condition and executes one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if it's false.
# if-elif-else statement:
It checks multiple condition in sequence and executes the block of code associated with the first true condition.If none of the conditions are true,the else block is executed.
# Nested-if:
Nested if statement in python allow you to have an if statement inside another if statement.

# Question No(1) write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it is an odd or even number?
